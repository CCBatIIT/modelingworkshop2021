Single 10 microseconds trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 dimeric main protease, NVT at 310K, 
with the time step 2.5fs (more precisely, 2.500000409 fs). The starting structure 
was prepared based on PDB 6LU7, with amber99sb-ildn force field. 
The system is composed of 98,694 atoms in 9.98921 nm length cubic box with periodic boundary conditions.
