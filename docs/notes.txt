* Go through the exercises a week before the workshop.

Revise the schedule:
* After the introductory remarks, give participants some time to download the virtual machine.
* Stretch Day 1 Period 1 over the entire day, splitting "Fundamentals of biological macromolecules" and "Structure determination" over two periods. Delay the rest of the workshop by one period.
* Describe the preparation of simulation models in more detail.
* Simulating and analyzing thermodynamic processes can be discussed in half a period. A practical exercise can be added.
* Binding free energy calculations can be covered in one period.
